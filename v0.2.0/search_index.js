Collaborative filtering frameworks basically are library with set of prediction and recommendation algorithms. Most don't provide tools that facilitate the construction of new algorithms. In some cases they provide, they don't use some scientific computation language and this making development more difficult.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In this scenario Persa will provide a set of tools that will facilitate the development of collaborative filtering algorithms. It will extend the Julia language by building a specific domain language (DSL) and thus increasing the productivity of development.

The purpose of this approach is to use user ratings to suggest some item that the user has not consumed and should like. This approach can be represented by a matrix where the content of it is the evaluation performed by the user on an item. However, this matrix is not necessarily complete since the user didn't necessarily consume all items.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"_ Item #1 Item #2 Item #3\nUser #1 4  2\nUser #2 4 5 3\nUser #3 3 4 \nUser #4  5 4","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Persa can be divided into large two parts: data access and predictive model","category":"page"},{"location":"#Data-1","page":"Home","title":"Data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The Persa.Preference represents all possibilities of ratings within a system.
